<p>Our goal is to make Oracle products, services, and supporting documentation accessible to all users, including users that are disabled. To that end, our documentation includes features that make information available to users of assistive technology. This documentation is available in HTML format, and contains markup to facilitate access by the disabled community. Accessibility standards will continue to evolve over time, and Oracle is actively engaged with other market-leading technology vendors to address technical obstacles so that our documentation can be accessible to all of our customers. For more information, visit the Oracle Accessibility Program Web site at <code><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/accessibility/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/accessibility/index.html</a></code>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility of Code Examples in Documentation</h2>
<p>Screen readers may not always correctly read the code examples in this document. The conventions for writing code require that closing braces should appear on an otherwise empty line; however, some screen readers may not always read a line of text that consists solely of a bracket or brace.</p>
<h2>Accessibility of Links to External Web Sites in Documentation</h2>
<p>This documentation may contain links to Web sites of other companies or organizations that Oracle does not own or control. Oracle neither evaluates nor makes any representations regarding the accessibility of these Web sites.</p>

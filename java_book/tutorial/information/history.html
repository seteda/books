<p>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 8u40 release.</p>
<p>This release includes a new lesson in the Deployment trail that describes how to use the Java packaging tools to generate self-contained applications. Self-contained applications are Java applications that are bundled with the JRE that is needed to run. These applications are installed on a user's local drive and launched in the same way as native applications. See <a href="../deployment/selfContainedApps/index.html">Deploying Self-Contained Applications</a> for more information.</p>

<p><a name="d_08_19_14" id="d_08_19_14"><strong>19 August 2014 -</strong></a></p> 
<p>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 8u20 release. This release includes the following changes:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>The Medium security level is no longer available in the Java Control Panel. To run applets locally, add them to the exception site list in the Java Control Panel. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/exception_site_list.html">Exception Site List</a> for information.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>A new processing limit property, <code>maxElementDepth</code>, has been added to JAXP. See <a href="../jaxp/limits/index.html">Processing Limits</a> for more information.</p></li>

  <li><p>Entry-Point attribute is a new attribute for the JAR file manifest. See <a href="../deployment/jar/secman.html"> Enhancing Security with Manifest Attributes</a> for information. </p></li>

</ul>


<p><a name="d_03_18_14" id="d_03_18_14"><strong>18 March 2014 -</strong></a></p>
<p>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 8 release. See <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-whats-new-2157071.html">What's New in JDK 8</a> for more information about new features in this release, which includes the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p><a href="../java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html">Lambda Expressions</a> enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="../java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">Default methods</a> are methods in an interface that have an implementation. They enable new functionality to be added to the interfaces of libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="../collections/streams/index.html">Aggregate operations</a> enable you to perform functional-style operations on streams of elements, in particular, bulk operations on collections, such as sequential or parallel map-reduce transformations.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="../datetime/index.html">Date-Time</a> APIs enable you to represent dates and times and manipulate date and time values. They support the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) calendar system as well as other commonly used global calendars.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="../java/annotations/type_annotations.html">Type annotations</a> can be used in conjunction with pluggable type systems for improved type checking, and <a href="../java/annotations/repeating.html">repeating annotations</a> enable to apply the same annotation to a declaration or type use.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Apart from fixing typos and errors, this update includes also includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The <a href="../security/index.html">Security</a> trail has been restructured; find security information about applets and Java Web Start applications in the <a href="../deployment/applet/index.html">Java Applets</a> lesson.</p></li>

<p>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 7u51 release. This release includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When signing a JAR file, time stamping the signature is recommended. A warning is shown if the signature is not time stamped. See <a href="../deployment/jar/signing.html">Signing JAR Files</a> for information.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="../java/generics/genTypeInference.html">Type Inference</a> section in the <a href="../java/generics/index.html">Generics</a> trail has been updated with the section Target Types, which describes how the Java compiler takes advantage of target typing to infer the type parameters of a generic method invocation in JDK 8.</p></li>
<li><p>You can obtain the names of the formal parameters of any method or constructor in JDK 8 with the method <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Executable.html#getParameters--">java.lang.reflect.Executable.getParameters</a>. See the section <a href="../reflect/member/methodparameterreflection.html">Obtaining Names of Method Parameters</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="../java/IandI/index.html">Interfaces and Inheritance</a> trail has been enhanced with information about <a href="../java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">Default Methods</a> in JDK 8, which are methods in an interface that have an implementation.

</ul>

<p><a name="d_10_15_13" id="d_10_15_13"><strong>15 October 2013 -</strong></a></p>
<p>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 7u45 release. This release includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../collections/" target="_blank">Collections</a> trail has been updated to recommend the preferred method of traversing collections with JDK 8: obtaining a stream and invoking its aggregate operations. Aggregate operations are often used in conjunction with lambda expressions to make programming more expressive, using less lines of code. The <a href="../collections/interfaces/collection.html" target="_blank">Collection</a>, <a href="../collections/interfaces/set.html" target="_blank">Set</a>, <a href="../collections/interfaces/list.html" target="_blank">List</a>, and <a href="../collections/interfaces/map.html" target="_blank">Map</a> interface pages now contain examples that demonstrate this new language feature.</li>

<p><a name="d_09_10_13" id="d_09_10_13"><strong>10 September 2013 -</strong></a></p>

<p>
This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 7u40 release. This release includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are pleased to announce the release of the new <a href="../datetime/index.html">Date-Time</a> trail as part of the early access JDK 8 tutorial updates. The Date-Time APIs, coming in JDK 8, are a result of the work from <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310" target="_blank">JSR 310</a> and provide a comprehensive model for date and time. The new trail covers the classes based on the standard ISO calendar system and includes info on <a href="../datetime/iso/nonIso.html" target="_blank">converting date and time values to other calendar systems</a>. There is also a <a href="../datetime/iso/legacy.html">Legacy Date-Time</a> page on migrating from the <tt>java.util</tt> date classes to the new <tt>java.time</tt> APIs. You can <a href="http://jdk8.java.net/download.html" target="_blank">download an early access release of JDK 8</a> from <tt>java.net</tt>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../collections/streams/index.html">Aggregate Data Operations</a> lesson has been added to the <a href="../collections/index.html">Collections</a> trail. Aggregate operations, a new feature coming in JDK 8, iterate over collections on your behalf, which enables you to write more concise and efficient code that processes elements stored in collections.</li>
<li>Running rich Internet applications (RIAs) through a browser can be risky for users due to the malicious intent of others looking for vulnerabilities through which to access a user's system. <a href="../deployment/doingMoreWithRIA/devGuidelines.html" target="_blank">Guidelines for Securing Rich Internet Applications</a>, in the Deployment trail, provide suggestions for making your RIAs less vulnerable to attack.</li>
<li>A new page, <a href="../i18n/locale/matching.html" target="_blank">Language Tag Filtering and Lookup</a>, has been added to the <a href="../i18n/index.html" target="_blank">Setting the Locale</a> lesson in the <a href="../i18n/index.html" target="_blank">Internationalization</a> trail. This page discusses language tags, languages ranges, and language priority lists. It also includes sections about language tag filtering and language tag lookup, with plenty of examples that you can compile and run.</li>
<li>The <a href="../jaxp/index.html">JAXP</a> trail has been updated with a new <a href="../jaxp/properties/index.html">JAXP 1.5 and New Properties</a> lesson.</li>
</ul>
<p>The download tutorial bundle, and the ebooks, available from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html">Java SE Tutorial download page</a>, have been updated for this release.</p>

<p><a name="d_06_18_13" id="d_06_18_13"><strong>18 June 2013 -</strong></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-7-tutorial-2012-02-28-1536013.html">downloadable tutorial bundle</a> has been updated for this release.</p>

<ul>
<li>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 7u25 release. The JDK 7u25 release introduces new JAR file manifest attributes that are used to defend Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) against unauthorized code repurposing. The <tt>Permissions</tt> and <tt>Codebase</tt> attributes are described in <a href="../deployment/jar/secman.html">Enhancing the Security of the JAR File</a>. The <a href="../deployment/applet/deployingApplet.html">Deploying an Applet</a> and <a href="../deployment/webstart/deploying.html">Deploying a Java Web Start Application</a> sections describe how to include these attributes in the manifest.</li>

<li>
Additional tips for deploying RIAs have been added to <a href="../deployment/deploymentInDepth/bestPractices.html">Deployment Best Practices</a> and <a href="../deployment/doingMoreWithRIA/security.html">Security in Rich Internet Applications</a>.</li>

<li>Information on time stamping the signature of a JAR file has been added to <a href="../deployment/jar/signing.html">Signing JAR Files</a>. Depending on the security level set in the Java Control Panel, RIAs that have an expired certificate might not be allowed to run. However, if the signature is time stamped and the time stamp shows that the certificate was valid when the RIA was signed, the RIA is allowed to run.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="d_04_16_13" id="d_04_16_13"><strong>16 April 2013 -</strong></a></p>

<p>The Deployment ebook (both mobi and epub formats) has been updated for this release.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This release of the tutorial corresponds to the JDK 7u21 release. The JDK 7u21 release enables users to make more informed decisions before running Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) by prompting users for permission before an RIA is run. The prompt contains information about the certificate used to sign the app and the level of access requested by the app. Depending on the security setting in the Java Control Panel, some apps might be blocked from running.</p>
<p>
The tutorials were updated to reflect the recommendation that all RIAs be run from signed JAR files. A new page has been added to the <a href="../deployment/index.html">Deployment</a> trail on <a href="../deployment/deploymentInDepth/userAcceptance.html" target="_blank">User Acceptance of RIAs</a>. You may also want to refer to the lesson on <a href="../deployment/jar/signindex.html" target="_blank">Signing and Verifying JAR Files</a>. Finally, all Java Web Start examples launched from within the tutorial are now signed and all applets run within the sandbox.</p>

<li><p>As part of the ongoing Project Lambda work for Java SE 8, there is a new page on <a href="../java/javaOO/methodreferences.html" target="_blank">Method References</a> and includes a new <a href="../java/javaOO/examples/MethodReferencesTest.java" target="_blank">MethodReferencesTest.java</a> example (which requires the <a href="http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/" target="_blank">early access release of JDK 8 with Lambda support</a> to compile).</p></li>

<li><p>Another feature coming to Java SE 8 is the ability to invoke methods that use the fork/join framework to sort arrays in parallel. The <a href="../java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html">Arrays</a> and <a href="../essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html">Fork/Join</a> pages have been updated with information on manipulating arrays.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a name="d_03_01_13" id="d_03_01_13"><strong>1 March 2013 -</strong></a></p>

<p>This online-only release of the Java Tutorial includes early access information on several upcoming features in the JDK 8 release:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lambda expressions, a result of the work of <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/" target="_blank">Project Lambda</a>, are a feature being added to the JDK 8 release of the Java platform. Lambda expressions support programming in a multicore environment by adding closures and related features to the Java language. An early access page on <a href="../java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html">Lambda Expressions</a> is part of this tutorial release. As part of this work, the information on <a href="../java/javaOO/nested.html">Nested Classes</a>, <a href="../java/javaOO/anonymousclasses.html">Anonymous Classes</a>, and <a href="../java/javaOO/localclasses.html">Local Classes</a> have been updated and a new page on <a href="../java/javaOO/whentouse.html">When to Use Nested Classes, Local Classes, Anonymous Classes, and Lambda Expressions</a> has been added.

JNDI tutorial, previously available on java.sun.com, has been moved
to the Java SE documentation archive on <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/">docs.oracle.com</a>
and many broken links in the tutorial have been fixed. The <a href=
"../jndi/">front page of the JNDI tutorial</a> has been modified
accordingly, and redirects are in place ensuring a seamless
transition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong id="d_07_07_10">7 July 2010 -</strong></p>
<p>This tutorial update represents the first release under its new
home at <code>docs.oracle.com</code>. Redirects are in place, so
any attempt to access the tutorials at
<code>java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial</code> will be redirected to
the new location. We hope this will be a seamless transition for
our many tutorial readers, but please let us know if you encounter
any problems.</p>

2007 -</strong></p>
<p>This push completes the tutorial update to JDK 6, with the
exception of the Swing drag and drop lesson, which is marked as
such. There are many updated pages, but the more notable changes
are:</p>

<p><strong>National Honesty Day, 30 April 2007 -</strong></p>
<p>This update focuses on the Swing tutorial - we have updated 80%
of the material in the Swing tutorial to the JDK 6 release.</p>
<p>A significant part of this effort makes our examples easier than
ever to use! The Swing examples are now packaged ready to use in
NetBeans IDE. Check out the <a href=
"../uiswing/examples/components/index.html">examples index</a> for
any of the Swing lessons (this link takes you to the Components
lesson, there is a separate index for each Swing lesson) and you
can download a zip file for any demo. Or you can visit the Check
out the <a href="examples.html">Running Tutorial Examples in
NetBeans IDE</a> page for more information on how to use the
examples with NetBeans. Visit the NetBeans IDE download page
to obtain release 5.5 of NetBeans IDE (it's free).</p>

(JNDI)</a></li>
<li><a href="../jmx">Java Management Extensions (JMX)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the update of the Swing trail to release 6 is in progress
and includes these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../uiswing/concurrency">Swing Concurrency</a> is a new
lesson that replaces the old "How to Use Threads" section. It

<li><a href="../ext">The Extension Mechanism</a></li>
</ul>
All examples in the basic tutorial and in the Swing tutorial have
been updated to compile against the 6.0 release. Applets and Java
web start applications require 6.0 to run. (The one exception are
the applets in the deployment/applet section that will run under
1.4 and 1.5.)
<p>You may notice that some very old parts of the tutorial have
been removed. The previous version of the tutorial is now available
via download. See the download page.</p>
<p>Finally, the tutorial itself has gotten a facelift, with a new
look and feel. Let us know what you think about these changes and
please let us know if you find any problems. Send feedback via our

archived and are now available via download. See the download page
for a complete list of available bundles.</li>
<li>You'll notice that the old applet and JAR sections have been
updated and moved to the new Deployment trail. You may notice
redirects if you have absolute links to the old pages.</li>
<li>We fixed the broken <a href="../search.html">search</a>
feature: it wasn't limiting its search to the tutorial. This is now
working correctly.</li>
<li>Across the tutorial, 1.0 and 1.1 examples have been removed.
The release 5 examples are located in "ex5" directories.</li>
<li>We have a new feedback form. It looks different,

</ul>
<p><strong>Dorothy's Birthday Release, 15 April 2005 -</strong></p>

Other changes include:
<ul>
<li>At readers' request, we changed the Feedback Form link at the
top of each window to bring up a new window so you don't lose the
page you're giving feedback about.</li>
<li>We started adding ZIP files so you can easily download all the
examples for a particular chapter.</li>
<li>We added 5.0 versions (including web start links) of the
examples in two Swing lessons: Getting Started with Swing and
Learning Swing by Example.</li>
<li>We moved several applets back to the pages where they're
referred to. Please let us know how you feel about this.
Another alternative for some of
these that aren't truly integrated with their page is to make them
web started applications.</li>
<li>We made many small changes - which you probably won't notice -
to clean up our HTML, reduce code sample line length where
necessary, and generally enable better generation of book files
from the HTML files.</li>
<li>Finally, we fixed the usual broken links, typos, and other
errata.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anya's Birthday Release, 14 Feb 2005 -</strong></p>

<li>JAR Files</li>
</ul>
Other, minor changes that you might notice include:
<ul>
<li>In the chapters where the content hasn't yet been updated, we
have updated some of the images. In some cases, this might lead to
a mismatch between the text (or code) and the image.</li>
<li>We have modified the page headers and the copyright notices.
This will cause each page to be updated, even if the content hasn't
yet changed.</li>
<li>Our <a href="../search.html">search page</a> has been fixed.
Thanks to those of you who reported that it was broken.</li>
<li>Finally, we fixed the usual broken links, typos, and other
errata.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Swing Book Release #2, 11 March 2004 -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an information page for our just-published book, <em>The
JFC Swing Tutorial, Second Edition</em>. It includes pointers to
other pages describing and book and CD contents, as well as
errata.</li>
<li>Added questions and exercises, along with answers, to the Swing
trail. These reflect the Questions and Exercises section at the end
of every non-reference chapter in the new book.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href=
"../uiswing/components/table.html#sorting">table sorting</a>
example to use a much more recent, functional, and robust version

</ul>
<p><strong>Swing Book Release, 20 February 2004 -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the first two lessons of the <a href=
"../uiswing/index.html">Swing trail</a> to 1.4 (with notes about
what's expected in 1.5): <a href=
"../uiswing/start/index.html">Getting Started with Swing</a> and
<a href="../uiswing/learn/index.html">Learning Swing by
Example</a>.</li>
<li>Throughout the tutorial, made the usual fixes to broken links,
typos, and other errata.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maya's Birthday Release, 3 November 03 -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the exception of the first two lessons, the <a href=
"../uiswing/index.html">Swing trail</a> has now been updated to 1.4
(with notes about what's expected in 1.5) and reflects what will be
published in the upcoming book. We'll note the biggest changes
here, but with so many changes, we can't mention them all.</li>
<li>After consulting with the Swing engineers, we changed our
thread safety recommendations and updated all but a few straggling
1.4 Swing examples to be thread safe. The newest recommendation is
this: <b>Build the GUI on the event-dispatching thread.</b> See How
to Use Threads for details.</li>
<li>Updated all pages in the Swing <a href=
"../uiswing/layout/index.html">layout</a> and <a href=
"../uiswing/events/index.html">events</a> lessons to 1.4.</li>
<li>Updated the accessibility, actions, threads, and timer pages in
the <a href="../uiswing/misc/index.html">Using Other Swing
Features</a> lesson to 1.4.</li>
<li>In the <a href="../uiswing/components/index.html">Using Swing
Components</a> lesson, updated the applet, root pane, spinner,
split pane, tabbed pane, table, tool bar, tool tip, tree, and all
text component pages to 1.4. Created pages for separators and
formatted text fields.</li>
<li>Completely rewrote the <a href=
"../uiswing/painting/index.html">painting</a> lesson. Instead of
featuring only the API in the <code>Graphics</code> class, it now
simply tells you what's special about painting Swing components and
refers you to the 2D trail for details.</li>
<li>Throughout the tutorial, made the usual fixes to broken links,
typos, and other errata.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Victoria Day (Canada), 19 May 03 -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added two completely new and much-requested pages to the Swing
part of the tutorial: How to Use Data Transfer (which covers drag
and drop and cut/copy/paste) and <a href=
"../uiswing/misc/focus.html">How to Use the Focus Subsystem</a>.
Many thanks to Shannon Hickey and Scott Violet for their reviews of
these rather long and technically complex sections.</li>
<li>Drastically changed the text and examples for <a href=
"../uiswing/layout/spring.html">How to Use SpringLayout</a>. It's
still unfinished, but should now be more useful. Many of the
<a href="../uiswing/layout/spring.html#eg">examples</a> use a
<code>SpringUtilities</code> class that makes it easy to build
grids of cells, including columns of label-text field pairs.</li>
<li>Updated the following Swing component reference pages to 1.4:
<a href="../uiswing/components/list.html">lists</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/panel.html">panels</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/progress.html">progress bars</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/menu.html">menus</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/scrollpane.html">scroll panes</a>, and
<a href="../uiswing/components/slider.html">sliders</a>. Added a
list of examples to the <a href=
"../uiswing/components/formattedtextfield.html#eg">formatted text
field</a> section.</li>
<li>Updated a couple of other Swing reference pages to 1.4:
borders, icons.</li>
<li>Updated applet tags throughout the tutorial to use
<code>APPLET</code> instead of
<code>OBJECT</code>/<code>EMBED</code>. This should make them
execute successfully in recent versions of Java Plug-in. Changed a
couple of applets to use <code>getResourceAsStream</code> instead
of <code>getResource</code> to load their images; this is more
efficient for applets using Java Plug-in.</li>
<li>Throughout the Swing examples, invoked
<code>setOpaque(true)</code> on <code>JPanel</code>s used as
content panes, to account for the fact that panels are no longer
opaque by default in every look and feel we distribute. (GTK+,
added in 1.4.2, has transparent panels.) Where possible, changed
examples that use <code>p = new JPanel(); p.setLayout(l)</code> to
use <code>p = new JPanel(l)</code>, to avoid the unnecessary
creation of <code>FlowLayout</code> objects.</li>
<li>Rewrote and reorganized much of the early part of the <a href=
"../uiswing/components/index.html">Swing components</a> lesson.
This included adding two new pages, with some new material and some
extracted from other pages: Using HTML in Swing Components and
<a href="../uiswing/components/model.html">Using Models</a>.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous fixes to broken links, typos, and the like.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Year of the Black Sheep (China), 3 February 03
-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganized and updated Setting the Look and Feel. It even has
information on the GTK and Windows XP look and feels, which will be
introduced in 1.4.2.</li>
<li>Added source code for the 1.4 events demos. We had released the
demos in runnable form soon after our last update, but without the
source code.</li>
<li>Updated the following pages in the components lesson to reflect
1.4 (and make any other improvements we could): <a href=
"../uiswing/components/jcomponent.html">JComponent</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/button.html">button</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/combobox.html">combo box</a>, <a href=
"../uiswing/components/colorchooser.html">color chooser</a>, and
<a href="../uiswing/components/frame.html">frame</a>.</li>
<li>Updated/added examples in the components lesson. New demo:
FrameDemo2. Added PNG support to FileChooserDemo2. Changed ListDemo
to not add a person if they already exist. Added a text input
dialog to DialogDemo.</li>
<li>Fixed the <a href=
"../java/javaOO/QandE/creating-answers.html">Creating Classes
answer page</a> to actually contain answers.</li>
<li>Updated our standard headers and footers to be more usable by
people with disabilities. These changes should be invisible to our
other readers.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous fixes to broken links, typos, and the like.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Onion Market Day (Switzerland), 25 November 02
-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We changed our external links to bring up new, blank windows
instead of named windows. Although this might result in an excess
of windows, it should solve the problem of people losing the named
windows.</li>
<li>We added many 1.4 examples to two of the Swing trail's lessons:
Using Swing Components and Using Other Swing Features. These
examples can be launched using Java<sup><font size=
"-2">TM</font></sup> Web Start, and the source files now list what
other files they need. The overall Swing example index now points
to all versions of the examples for each lesson.</li>
<li>We added a page on <a href=
"../uiswing/misc/keybinding.html">key bindings</a> to the Using
Other Swing Features lesson. We also updated the <a href=
"../uiswing/misc/action.html">action</a> and <a href=
"../uiswing/misc/access.html">accessibility</a> pages.</li>
<li>In the <a href="../uiswing/components/index.html">Swing
components</a> lesson, we changed the order of the pages and
updated all the pages up through and including buttons.</li>
<li>We're still in the process of updating the <a href=
"../uiswing/index.html">Creating a GUI with JFC/Swing</a> trail to
1.4. You might notice some changes or notes about changes we plan
to make.</li>
<li>We added a Java Web Start page to help people install and use
that software.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous fixes to broken links and typos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Robinson Crusoe's Birthday, 30 September 02
-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We added a <b>new lesson!</b> <a href=
"../essential/regex/index.html">Regular Expressions</a> covers the
<code>java.util.regex</code> API introduced in the 1.4 release of
the Java&trade; 2 Platform Standard Edition. Regular expressions
can be used as a tool to search, edit, or manipulate text or data.
This package uses Perl-like syntax, but our lesson doesn't assume
that you've had previous experience with regular expressions.</li>
<li>The Tutorial <b>front page has completely changed</b>, and the

</ul>
<p><strong>Saturnalia, 22 December 97 - <em>The long awaited
update!</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a <em>major</em> update of the tutorial. Almost every
file has been touched in some way.</p>
<p>This release of the online tutorial corresponds with the release
of the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book and is the
version of the online tutorial that appears on the CD-ROM that
accompanies that book.</p>
<p>The changes are in progress, but to a large extent we have
integrated 1.1 information into the existing trails, lessons, and
examples. This is in sharp contrast to the 1.1 notes that were
littered throughout the previous version of the tutorial and were,
admittedly, somewhat confusing.</p>
<p>Also, we are in the process of integrating copyedit and other
changes made to the book version, into the online version. This has
been completed thoroughly in some areas of the online tutorial, and
spottily in other areas. We will continue with this process
throughout the coming months.</p>
<p>New lessons in this tutorial that first appeared in print in the
2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Java Phenomenon</strong></li>
<li><strong>Migrating to 1.1</strong></li>
<li><strong>A Preview of Things to Come</strong></li>
</ul>
New trails for this version of the tutorial that haven't yet made
it to print:
<ul>
<li>Added a <strong>Putting It All Together</strong> trail that
provides a large, real-world, client/server example and analyzes
it.</li>
<li>Got a totally new <strong>JavaBeans Tutorial</strong> by Andy
Quinn!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8 July 97 -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the goals of the tutorial is to document the latest and
greatest from JavaSoft <em>as it is released</em>. To this end,
we've added a lesson about <strong>Using Swing Components</strong>.
The Swing release is an early release of part of the JFC. This
information is only available from the Java Tutorial.</li>
<li>Added a trail, <strong>Java Security 1.1</strong>, covering the
new 1.1 security APIs.</li>
<li>Updated the The JavaBeans(tm) Tutorial by Greg Voss.</li>
<li>Promoted <strong>Writing Global Programs</strong> to a trail.
This trail is still in progress, but it contains new material
including several excellent demos from
<strong>Taligent</strong>.</li>
<li>Added information about the 1.1 release in our <strong>To 1.1 -
And Beyond!</strong> trail.</li>
<li>Made the usual fixes to broken links, typos, and other
errata.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14 May 97 -</strong></p>
<p>We improved and added more 1.1 information in existing sections.
We added more examples of and information about the various types
of event listeners to <strong>Handling Events</strong>. We also
fixed the AroundTheWorld applet used in <strong>Writing Global
Programs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>28 April 97 -</strong></p>
<p>We added a new trail, <strong>To 1.1 - And Beyond!</strong>,
which is the headquarters for features added to the JDK after 1.0.
Also, the <strong>Learning the Java Language</strong> and
<strong>Essential Java Classes</strong> trails now have notes that
point out material that is affected by 1.1. And finally, we
reorganized our top-level files to make them more accessible.</p>
<p><strong>3 March 97 -</strong></p>
<p>Added a brand new trail introducing JavaBeans! This trail,
JavaBeans Tutorial, written by Greg Voss, shows you the ins and
outs of developing programs using the JavaBeans technology.</p>
<p><strong>19 February 97 -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our new "guest author" program debuts in this release of the
tutorial with a completely new trail about writing native methods
by Beth Stearns. Check it out: <strong>Using the Java Native
Interface (JNI)</strong>.</li>
<li>Merged copyediting changes from the book into the on-line
version in these two trails: <strong>Getting Started</strong> and
<strong>Writing Applets</strong>.</li>
<li>Updated <strong>Writing Global Programs</strong> to work with
the FCS JDK 1.1 release.</li>
<li>The usual miscellaneous fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>24 December 96 -</strong></p>
<p>Miscellaneous fixes. Also, added a new lesson describing new
features of the JDK for <strong>Writing Global
Programs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>6 June 96 -</strong></p>
<p>Released the Sixth DRAFT. This draft is the version on which the
book version is based. The book and online versions aren't exactly
the same - for example, none of the copyeditor's changes have made
it into the online tutorial yet. Also, the online tutorial's
figures haven't been updated to be the same as those in the book.
Notable content changes since the fifth draft include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished the Common Problems pages.</li>
<li>Added information on the Macintosh JDK.</li>
<li>Added an applet anatomy section to Getting Started.</li>
<li>Improved the talk server example in the applet communication
lesson.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>28 Mar 96 -</strong></p>
<p>Released the Fifth DRAFT. Many pages in this draft have been
rewritten or expanded upon. (If you've sent us comments and don't
see them reflected in this draft, please don't be insulted - we
haven't finished incorporating reviewer comments.) Some of the
notable changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revised Application Anatomy lesson and moved it to the Getting
Started trail: <strong>The Anatomy of a Java Application</strong>.
We plan to write an equivalent section for applets.</li>
<li>Did major rewrites of the following lessons in the Java trail:
<strong>The Nuts and Bolts of the Java Language</strong> and
<strong>Objects and Classes in Java</strong>.</li>

HTML Page and <strong>Summary</strong>.</li>
<li>Beefed up the applet threads pages: <strong>Threads in

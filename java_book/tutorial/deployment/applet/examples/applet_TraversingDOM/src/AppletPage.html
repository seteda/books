        <h1>Traversing DOM</h1>
        <p>
            This test uses an applet and the Common DOM API to dump the DOM of the
        web page to System.out.</p>
        <p>See the <i>Java Console</i> for the output. No
            exceptions should be reported, and a reasonable representation of the
            web page's contents should be printed.

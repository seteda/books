Wolfenstein 3D for Linux - http://www.icculus.org/wolf3d/
------------------------

This is an in-progress port of the id Software MS-DOS game, Wolfenstein 3D,
to the GNU/Linux operating system.

Save game and configuration file formats are not yet "solid" (files created
with an older version may not work with a new binary), but they probably
won't have to change.

NOTE: This requires SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org)

NOTE: edit version.h to change the gametype.
